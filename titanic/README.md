# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

The model was developed using the Ensemble method, which combines predictions from multiple individual classifiers to improve overall performance. 

Four classifiers were evaluated using Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning:
- Random Forest,
- SGD Classifier,
- Multi-layer Perceptron,
- - K-nearest neighbors (due to low accuracy it was omitted after performing Grid Search).

Final accuracy obtained in this process is **0.76076**.
